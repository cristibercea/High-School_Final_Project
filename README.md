# Minesweeper...with a twist?
 - this project is, basically, a classical Minesweeper with 3 levels and a list with last 10 players (and their performance) <b>but</b>...
 - ...but instead of instantly losing when blowing up a mine, the player keeps on playing, until all non-mined spaces are revealed
 - if the game is won, the player gets to know his accuracy and is added to the list in the <i>Main Menu</i>
 - a presentation of the project is attached here (<b>in Romanian</b>): [Prezentare_atestat_Bercea_Cristian.pdf](https://github.com/cristibercea/Final-High-School-Project/files/13531812/Prezentare_atestat_Bercea_Cristian.pdf)
