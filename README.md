# Minesweeper...with a twist?
 - Project made with [Microsoft Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/) (<b><i>version 2017</i></b>)
 - This project is, basically, a classical Minesweeper with 3 levels (3 difficulties) and a list with last 10 players that won (and their performance) <b>but...</b>
 - <b>...but</b> instead of instantly losing when blowing up a mine, the player keeps on playing, until all non-mined spaces are revealed
 - If the game is won, the player gets to know their accuracy and is added to the list in the <i>Main Menu</i>
 - The presentation of the project is attached here (<b>in Romanian</b>): [Prezentare.pdf](https://github.com/cristibercea/Final-High-School-Project/files/13531812/Prezentare_atestat_Bercea_Cristian.pdf)
